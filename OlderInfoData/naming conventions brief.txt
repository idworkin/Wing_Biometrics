Naming  conventions

Sam_10514_Sam_1 rep 1
Samw_Sam_Sam_M_rep2_01

For this example I have only given two genotypes the wild type (Samw_Sam_Sam) and the mutant (with 10514)


The first Sam or Samw i just a note for the genetic background used in this study.

 The second two (which will have either Sam or a number) will represent whether the chromosome is wild-type (Sam) or mutant (each number represents a particular mutation).

M is for male

rep1 VS rep2 are two seperate biological replicates.
